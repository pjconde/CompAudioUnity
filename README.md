Unity program I made for us to use in order to play the sounds for our phase 2 VR user testing. The purpose of this is not to be played by the actual user. This is to be used to play the sounds

### Controls:
  - Moving: Arrow Keys

  - O: Plays Low oxygen noise
  - R: Plays relaxation noise
  - D: Plays depth watch noice
  - Spacebar: Plays attention grabbing noise

The heartbeat sound/ sound to know the device is on plays on it's own
